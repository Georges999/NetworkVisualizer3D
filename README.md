# NetworkVisualizer3D
NetworkVisualizer3D transforms network traffic data into an interactive 3D city visualization, where devices appear as buildings, connections as roads, and data flows as vehicles. Built with .NET Core and Unity, it features real-time monitoring, protocol differentiation, timeline controls for historical playback, and threat visualization. The tool leverages SharpPcap for packet capture and 3D rendering techniques to make network monitoring more intuitive and engaging.
STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT
